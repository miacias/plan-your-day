# Plan Your Day 

## Description 

This daily planner is designed for society's hard worker with the typical nine-to-five active hours in mind. The motivation behind this planner is to help the user plan one day at a time and receive visual feedback as the hours pass. A day-planner such as this removes the need for users to memorize daily tasks and instead provides a reliable place to write everything down.

In making this planner, I learned better how to use jQuery to write JavaScript in shorthand. I also learned, however, that recent developments in JavaScript versioning are catching up to jQuery's previously uncontested optimizations. Regarding formatting, it is important to take careful note of Bootstrap class items and CSS so as to not incorporate conflicting stylizations.


## Installation 

N/A. [Deployed site here!](https://miacias.github.io/plan-your-day/)
 

## Usage 

Click or tap in an hour-block to add text. Be sure to click or tap the "Save" icon to the left of the block after adding text so that the page may be closed without losing information. Reopen the page any time to check what is planned and keep track of the day. As an added feature, there is a "Clear Your Day" button which allows the user to empty the entire planner to start fresh with a new day - or to take a much deserved rest.
 
Below is an image of a clear and free day once 5pm has passed and each time block is darkened. The planner while still during active hours has brighter hues and colors:

## How to Contribute 

 
 

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
